# Weather Report App
Hi! This is my weather app, I built it using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.

This app was my introduction and first project using APIs in JS. You can search a city from all over the world and obtain its current weather, along with other data like the wind speed and humidity.

You can obtain the data in two different units: the "metric" and "imperial" system. I also recommend using the following pattern to search for the specific city that you want to consult: e.g. 'Maracaibo, VE', 'Rome, IT', 'Buenos Aires, AR', 'New York, US'...

Thanks for visiting my repo! <3
